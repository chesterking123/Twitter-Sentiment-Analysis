# Sentiment Analysis of a Netflix Film : All The Bright Places

In this project I have scraped tweets with hashtag #AlltheBrightPlaces and processed the text using Natural Language Toolkit after which the tweets were catogarized into positive reviews and negative reviews using TestBlob sentiment analyser. Finally using some visualizations I have calculated and visualized the Audience Score for the movie.
